# basel-mean_temperature-prediction

Developed a linear regression model to estimate average temperature in Basel from meteorological data. Achieved a high R² score and gained hands-on experience with exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and model evaluation.

⚠️ Model Validity Note:
The predictors in this project have a direct mathematical relationship with the target variable. This violates key assumptions of supervised learning and results in an artificially inflated performance metric. The project remains as a valuable learning exercise in modeling and critical assessment.

⚠️ This is a learning project. Some modeling choices are intentionally revisited to understand their impact.
